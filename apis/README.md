The steps of creating a new CRD or updating the existing CRD are as follow:
1. Create or update the CustomResourceDefinition yaml in `../crd/`
2. Update `./checkpointing.gke.io/v1/types.go`
3. Run `../hack/update-crd-codegen.sh` (this will also run as part of `../hack/update-codegen.sh`).

It seems like we should be able to generate the CRD yaml automatically, but we
haven't figured that out yet. Note that only the `types.go` files are manually
written, the rest is autogenerated.
